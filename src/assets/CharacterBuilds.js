Don't waste too many points here though, say around 100-120.</dd> <dd><b>DEX</b> - Dexterity gives Attack rating and extra damage. 1 point gives +1% damage. 300 dex gives +300% damage and lots of Attack rating. Put lots of points here... nuff said.</dd> <dd><b>VIT</b> - If you die, put more here. Hiding Behind your Valkyrie, moving smart and stopping mobs with freezing arrow you'll stay out of harms way. That is your job as a ranged class anyways.</dd> <dd><b>ENG</b> - Nothing. Can be tough in the beginning of the game but soon enough you'll leech the mana back in no time.</dd></dl>",

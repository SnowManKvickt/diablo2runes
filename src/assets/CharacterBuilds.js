                message: "<v-img :src='https://filecdn015924bits1.ladderstats.com/diablo2/Bowazon_Skill_Tree.jpg'> </v-img> <p> Proper allocation of the Bowazon's attributes is vital to her success and she needs to spend her points very carefully in order to be effective all the way through the Hell difficulty. The biggest issue the Bowazon has to deal with is that unlike the Assassin, Paladin or Barbarian, she has no Mastery skills or Auras to help her in combat. This creates two fundamental issues for the build: a) her attack rating is anemic to say the least b) her damage is nowhere near where it could be. To make things worse, most of her skills do not particularly help in these departments, especially when it comes to attack rating. </p> <p>Therefore, Strength needs to get only as many points as is absolutely necessary and not a point more. The highest Strength requirement for bows is 140, while for crossbows it goes up to 165 (163 to be exact). It is NOT recommended to aim (pun freaking intended) for crossbows from the get-go as while they do provide better damage than bows, they do not possess supreme attack speed (except for Repeating Crossbows which act more like bows but with even higher attack speed and even less damage). I would only recommend Crossbows for advanced players with good ability to judge a situation or for those who have already found a decent rare/unique crossbow during their playthrough which they intend to finish the game with. I would think that I fulfill both criteria and it didn't pay off anyway (I found Hellcast, added a Shael Rune and intended to upgrade the weapon all the way to Colossus Crossbow, but unfortunately didn't find the necessary runes and never made it past Ballista). It is a big gamble to go for Crossbows as you don't know if you'll ever get a good one and putting points in Strength hurts. Honest! It physically hurts to click the button to add Strength. The attribute gives you NOTHING. Your damage is determined by Dexterity alone, so the only thing Strength does for you is fulfill item requirements. Also, the Bowazon is a ranged build so high armor is useless to you making the stat even more useless. Spend extra points at your own peril (I'll find you and beat the crap out of you if you get it above 165!). What you see in the picture is the absolute maximum of what Strength you should ever have. If you don't want to go for crossbows, feel free to move 25 points from Strength to...something else.</p> <p>Dexterity is the very essence of this build. Not only is it required for bows (highest requirement being around 190), it also adds damage which you sorely need, as well as increases your attack rating, which you need even more desperately. This should and will be your primary stat, so pour as many points as you can spare here. You'll not like your gameplay experience if you don't.</p> <p>Vitality is the hairy stat in this build. There is no strict limit how high you should get it unlike Strength, yet it is still needed. Keep in mind however, that you are a ranged and ranged only character. You are not a Javazon who needs to close in every now and then, or a Sorceress who can pummel anyone with Fireballs if they get in her face. You kill slowly, so you need to do it from range. Never ever have an enemy right in front of you, always kite them away or you'll stand no chance (the only exception being if the enemy is being Freezing Arrowed to death, then it's ok). Therefore, your Vitality investment doesn't need to be as high as with other characters IF you play carefully and always mind your surroundings (Batman reference FTW). Large AoE spells and stray missiles still do pose a problem however and your resistances might not be all that great since you are not using a shield and other affixes on items might be more important, so you still need to get your Vit up. I wouldn't recommend going lower than 80, even with a hundred there was a bunch of close calls in my playthrough and it's better to be safe.</p> <p>Last and by all means least there is Energy. Even though your character is in a way a hybrid between a fighter and a caster (you do use your weapon to attack but you also spam skills from range like crazy), do not invest any points into Energy. You need Dexterity too damn much to waste points here and more importantly, even 60 points in energy wouldn't save you, as Freezing Arrow eats mana for breakfast. Getting out 4-5 extra arrows for your Mana isn't worth the investment. At the start of the game Mana will most likely be your biggest problem and in fact will remain so even in Hell, as regardless of your mana steal, Freezing Arrow deals very little physical damage from which you can steal mana. The rest of your skills are not that Mana intensive, but unfortunately also need to be spammed a lot. The only way your mana will be pretty ok will be if you get ca 10% mana steal or you use a crossbow (crossbows deal more damage per shot, giving you more mana stolen, plus enemies will die with fewer uses of your skills due to the increase in damage). Even then, it is still better to drink potions than waste stat points; potions are aplenty, stat points are not.</p>",
